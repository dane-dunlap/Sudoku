# Sudoku

This is a fully functional Sudoku game created using Pygame.

The program receives a solvable Sudoku Board via the Sugoku API and uses a backtracking algorithmn to solve the board.

The API is currently down from Sugoku's side so for the time being the game loads the same pre-set board each time.

Players can click f to visualize how the backtracking algorithmn works!

After you make 3 errors, you lose the game

Finish the board to win!
